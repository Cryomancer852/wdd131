        <h2>Course Expectations</h2>
        <p>With my professional experience, the course's incomplete instructions and over use of an audit tool that fails to provide clear feedback, I have low expectations regarding the quality of this course and it's value to my higher eduation.</p>

        <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
        <p>I teach programming to youth 8 - 18, through the medium of video games and game design, I have seen the direct issues with code validation and incomplete or unclear instructions and the harm it has on education. In my own work we have worked to improve the validation and use it as little as possible, due to the unhelpful feedback it provides. </p>
